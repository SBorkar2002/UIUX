# DESCRIPTION 

In my redesigned version of the Booking.com user interface, I focused on creating a cleaner, more intuitive, and visually appealing layout while retaining all the core functionalities that users rely on. My goal was to enhance the user experience by making the design more accessible, organized, and engaging for both new and returning users.

1. Simplified Layout & Better Structure
One of the first changes I made was streamlining the layout to reduce visual noise. The original version had a lot of overlapping information and tight spacing, which could easily overwhelm a user. I addressed this by introducing more white space between sections, allowing the content to breathe. This not only makes the page feel less cluttered but also makes it easier for users to scan and navigate. Each section now has a clear boundary, making transitions from one category to another smoother and more defined.

2. Improved Visual Hierarchy
To make sure users always know where to look, I implemented a more consistent and effective visual hierarchy. I used bold, clearly defined section titles and subheadings that stand out without overpowering the rest of the design. Font sizes, weights, and colors were selected to maintain readability and visual flow. This ensures that users can quickly identify different content blocks like offers, destinations, property types, and deals. Instead of having all text treated equally, the design now guides users’ eyes naturally across the interface—from the headline all the way to action buttons.

3. More Engaging Cards
The card-based components for destinations and hotel listings were completely reworked. I added subtle shadows, increased padding, and chose higher-resolution images that add visual richness to the cards. The content within the cards is now better balanced, with clear titles, ratings, pricing, and labels such as “Getaway Deal” prominently highlighted. These changes make the cards much more interactive and attractive, inviting users to click through and explore further.

4. Refined Navigation Icons
The top navigation menu was an area I intentionally kept simple but visually refined. The icons now align better, both in terms of spacing and size, which helps users easily recognize different services—like stays, flights, car rentals, and airport taxis. A more consistent icon style across the navigation also improves the overall polish of the UI. Additionally, hover effects and minor animations give the interface a responsive feel without being distracting.

5. Clearer CTAs & Deal Highlights
I redesigned the call-to-action buttons like “Search,” “Show Prices,” and “Discover Homes” to be more visually prominent. They now have better contrast, padding, and hover states, encouraging more engagement. Tags like “Getaway Deal” have also been made more noticeable with a stronger background color and more legible text, so users can spot offers immediately without needing to search.

6. Organized Footer
The original footer had a dense, almost overwhelming number of links that weren’t grouped in a user-friendly way. I reorganized the footer into clearly labeled columns—Support, Discover, Terms and Settings, Partners, and About. This not only looks cleaner but also helps users quickly find the links they need, whether it’s customer service, travel articles, or legal information.
